<p>This is a sample Debug webpage. 
It uses the dev_shim to pull in each individual js and css file.</p>

<p>You can optionally call window.patch_jquery(). 
To ensure that any calls to $(function() {}) won't run until all dev scripts have downloaded. 
If you choose to do this, the dev_shim must load jquery.</p>

<script src="./src/dev_shim.js"></script>
<script>
window.load_manifests(["main"], '')
